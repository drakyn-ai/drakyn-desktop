# Proactive Agent Architecture

## Vision

Transform drakyn-desktop from a **reactive chat agent** into a **proactive, context-aware assistant** that lives in the background and actively helps manage your life.

### Key Behaviors

The agent should:
- **Learn about the user** - Ask questions to understand their life, goals, and patterns
- **Monitor relevant context** - Check emails, calendar, files, system state
- **Suggest helpful actions** - Proactively offer assistance based on learned context
- **Respect boundaries** - Be helpful but not intrusive, with configurable interaction frequency

### Example Use Cases

**For a busy parent:**
- "I noticed you have a dentist appointment tomorrow at 2pm. Would you like me to set a reminder 30 minutes before?"
- "Your daughter's school sent an email about the permission slip due Friday. Should I help you draft a response?"
- "I see you're working late tonight. Would you like me to order dinner from your usual place?"

**For a professional:**
- "You have 3 unread emails from your manager. Would you like a summary?"
- "Your presentation is in 2 hours. I can help you review the slides one more time."
- "I noticed you've been working on this bug for 3 hours. Would you like me to search for similar issues?"

## Architecture Components

### 1. User Context System

**Location**: `~/.drakyn/user_context.txt`

A simple plain text file that the agent reads and updates. Written in natural language that the LLM can easily understand and modify.

**Example:**

```
About Chanh:
- Has a daughter in elementary school (7 years old)
- Works as a software engineer, typical hours 9am-5pm
- Located in Pacific timezone
- Prefers concise notifications, doesn't like being interrupted during focus time
- Usually goes to bed around 10pm, wakes up around 7am

Family & Relationships:
- Daughter: Emma, age 7, attends Lincoln Elementary
- Important contacts: boss@company.com, emma.teacher@school.org

Work Patterns:
- Deep work time: 9am-12pm (minimize interruptions)
- Check emails: Usually at 8am, 12pm, 4pm
- Meeting-heavy days: Tuesdays and Thursdays
- Prefers async communication when possible

Preferences:
- Proactive level: moderate (check in a few times per day, not constantly)
- Notification style: Brief and actionable
- Quiet hours: 10pm - 7am (no notifications)
- Helpful: Appointment reminders 30min before, email summaries from important people
- Not helpful: Interruptions during meetings, dinner suggestions during work hours

Recent Patterns & Context:
- Oct 18: Worked late until 11pm (deadline crunch)
- Oct 19: Dentist appointment at 2pm (went well)
- Oct 20: Mentioned being busy this week with project launch
- Typical Friday: Orders pizza for family dinner

Things I've Learned Work Well:
- Morning check-in around 8:30am with day overview
- Flagging urgent emails from boss or school
- Reminding about permission slips and school events
- Helping draft quick email responses

Things That Weren't Helpful:
- Suggesting actions during meetings
- Too many notifications in one hour
- Overly detailed summaries when busy
```

**Why Plain Text?**
- ✅ LLMs are designed to understand natural language
- ✅ Agent can read, update, and reorganize it naturally
- ✅ Human-readable and editable by user
- ✅ No rigid schema - can evolve organically
- ✅ Simple to back up and version control
- ✅ Easy to debug - just read the file

### 2. Background Monitor Service

**Location**: `src/services/monitor/service.py`

Runs continuously in the background, checking various data sources:

```python
# monitor/service.py

class BackgroundMonitor:
    """
    Monitors user context and triggers proactive suggestions.
    Runs as a separate process managed by Electron.
    """

    async def run_monitoring_loop(self):
        """Main loop - runs every N minutes"""
        while True:
            # Gather current context snapshot
            context = await self.gather_context()

            # Ask agent to analyze context and suggest actions
            suggestions = await self.analyze_with_agent(context)

            # Send suggestions to notification system
            if suggestions:
                await self.notify_user(suggestions)

            # Sleep based on user's preferences (read from user_context.txt)
            await asyncio.sleep(self.get_check_interval())

    async def gather_context(self) -> str:
        """
        Collect current context and format as plain text.
        Returns a context snapshot that will be given to the agent.
        """
        lines = []
        lines.append(f"Current Time: {datetime.now().strftime('%I:%M %p, %A %B %d, %Y')}")
        lines.append("")

        # Check emails (use Gmail tool)
        emails = await self.check_emails()
        if emails:
            lines.append("Recent Emails:")
            for email in emails[:5]:
                lines.append(f"  - From {email['from']}: {email['subject']}")
            lines.append("")

        # Check calendar (use Calendar tool when implemented)
        events = await self.check_calendar()
        if events:
            lines.append("Upcoming Events (next 24 hours):")
            for event in events:
                lines.append(f"  - {event['time']}: {event['title']}")
            lines.append("")

        # Check system state
        system = await self.check_system_state()
        lines.append("System State:")
        lines.append(f"  - Battery: {system['battery']}%")
        lines.append(f"  - Active: {system['active_window']}")
        lines.append("")

        return "\n".join(lines)
```

### 3. Context Analysis Engine

**Location**: `src/services/monitor/analyzer.py`

Uses the agent's LLM to analyze context and generate suggestions:

```python
class ContextAnalyzer:
    """
    Analyzes user context to generate proactive suggestions.
    Uses LLM to understand context and formulate helpful actions.
    """

    async def analyze_with_agent(self, context_snapshot: str) -> List[dict]:
        """
        Main analysis function - uses agent's LLM to reason about context.

        Constructs a prompt with:
        1. User context (from ~/.drakyn/user_context.txt)
        2. Current situation (from context_snapshot)
        3. Instructions to suggest helpful actions
        """

        # Read user context file
        user_context = self.read_user_context()

        # Build prompt
        prompt = f"""You are Drakyn, a proactive AI assistant.

What you know about the user:
{user_context}

Current situation:
{context_snapshot}

Based on what you know about the user and their current situation:
1. Are there any helpful actions you could take right now?
2. Consider: upcoming events, important emails, battery level, time of day
3. Respect the user's preferences about notification frequency and style

If you have 1-3 helpful suggestions, respond with them in this format:
SUGGESTIONS:
- [Brief description of action]: [Why this would be helpful]

If nothing urgent or helpful right now, respond with:
NO_SUGGESTIONS

Remember: Better to stay quiet than be annoying. Only suggest truly helpful things.
"""

        # Call agent's LLM (reuse existing orchestrator)
        response = await self.call_agent(prompt)

        # Parse suggestions from response
        suggestions = self.parse_suggestions(response)

        return suggestions
```

### 4. Learning System

**Location**: `src/services/learning/system.py`

The agent learns by asking questions and updating its own context file:

```python
class LearningSystem:
    """
    Manages the process of learning about the user over time.
    The agent updates its own user_context.txt file as it learns.
    """

    async def should_ask_question(self) -> bool:
        """
        Ask the agent if it wants to learn more about the user.
        Reads user_context.txt and decides if there are gaps.
        """
        user_context = self.read_user_context()

        prompt = f"""You are Drakyn, a proactive AI assistant.

What you currently know about the user:
{user_context}

Looking at what you know, is there important information missing that would help you be more helpful?
Consider: work schedule, family, preferences, important contacts, daily routines

If you'd like to ask 1 question to learn more, respond with:
QUESTION: [Your question]

If you have enough context for now, respond with:
NO_QUESTION
"""

        response = await self.call_agent(prompt)
        return self.parse_question(response)

    async def update_context_from_answer(self, question: str, answer: str):
        """
        Agent updates user_context.txt based on the user's answer.
        Uses the update_user_context tool.
        """
        user_context = self.read_user_context()

        prompt = f"""You asked the user: "{question}"
They responded: "{answer}"

Current user context file:
{user_context}

Update the user context file to include this new information.
Integrate it naturally into the existing context.

Use the update_user_context tool to rewrite the file.
"""

        # Agent will call update_user_context tool to modify the file
        await self.call_agent_with_tools(prompt)
```

### 5. Notification System

**Location**: `src/services/notifications/`

Delivers suggestions to the user:

```python
class NotificationManager:
    """
    Manages delivery of proactive suggestions to user.
    """

    async def notify(self, suggestion: Suggestion):
        """Send notification to user"""
        # Options:
        # 1. System notification (via Electron)
        # 2. In-app badge/indicator
        # 3. Chat message in main window
        pass

    def should_notify_now(self, suggestion: Suggestion, profile: UserProfile) -> bool:
        """Determine if this is a good time to notify"""
        # Respect quiet hours
        # Check notification frequency limits
        # Consider priority level
        pass
```

### 6. Suggestion History

**Location**: `~/.drakyn/suggestion_history.txt`

Simple append-only log that the agent can reference:

```
[2024-10-20 14:30] SUGGESTED: Remind about dentist appointment at 2pm
  USER: Accepted, set reminder
  HELPFUL: Yes

[2024-10-20 16:45] SUGGESTED: Order dinner from usual pizza place
  USER: Dismissed
  HELPFUL: No - user said too early to think about dinner

[2024-10-21 08:30] SUGGESTED: Summary of 3 unread emails from boss
  USER: Accepted, read summary
  HELPFUL: Yes
```

The agent reads this file to learn what kinds of suggestions are helpful.

## Communication Flow

### Proactive Suggestion Flow

```
1. BACKGROUND MONITOR (runs every 30-60 minutes)
   ├─ Gather context snapshot (emails, calendar, system state)
   └─ Format as plain text

2. CONTEXT ANALYZER
   ├─ Read user_context.txt
   ├─ Build prompt with user context + current snapshot
   ├─ Call agent's LLM
   └─ Parse suggestions from response

3. NOTIFICATION MANAGER
   ├─ Check if appropriate time to notify
   ├─ Format suggestion as notification
   └─ Send to Electron main process

4. ELECTRON MAIN PROCESS
   ├─ Create system notification
   └─ Update UI with suggestion badge

5. USER INTERACTION
   ├─ User clicks notification
   ├─ Opens suggestion panel in app
   ├─ User can: accept, dismiss, or provide feedback
   └─ Action appended to suggestion_history.txt
```

### Learning Question Flow

```
1. LEARNING SYSTEM (runs periodically, max 3x per day)
   ├─ Read user_context.txt
   ├─ Ask agent if it needs more information
   └─ Agent generates question if needed

2. NOTIFICATION
   ├─ Send question as chat message
   └─ Mark as "learning question" (special formatting)

3. USER RESPONDS
   ├─ Answer in natural language
   └─ Learning system processes answer

4. CONTEXT UPDATE
   ├─ Agent reads current user_context.txt
   ├─ Agent calls update_user_context tool
   ├─ Tool rewrites user_context.txt with new info
   └─ Agent thanks user and confirms understanding
```

## Configuration

### User Settings

```json
{
  "proactive_agent": {
    "enabled": true,
    "level": "moderate",  // minimal | moderate | active
    "check_interval_minutes": 30,
    "quiet_hours": {
      "enabled": true,
      "start": "22:00",
      "end": "07:00"
    },
    "notification_channels": {
      "system_notifications": true,
      "in_app_badge": true,
      "chat_messages": false
    },
    "learning": {
      "enabled": true,
      "max_questions_per_day": 3
    }
  }
}
```

## Privacy Considerations

1. **Data Storage**: All data in plain text files at `~/.drakyn/`
2. **No Cloud Sync**: User data never leaves the device (unless explicitly enabled)
3. **Human-Readable**: User can open and read/edit their context file anytime
4. **Clear Controls**: Easy toggle to disable proactive features
5. **Data Deletion**: Just delete the `~/.drakyn/` directory
6. **Transparency**: User can see exactly what the agent knows about them

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features

1. **Multi-User Support**: Different profiles for different family members
2. **Smart Scheduling**: Learn optimal times for different types of suggestions
3. **Voice Interactions**: "Hey Drakyn, what's on my agenda?"
4. **Mobile Companion**: Sync context across devices
5. **Integrations**:
   - Spotify (music preferences)
   - GitHub (coding patterns)
   - Browser history (research topics)
   - Food delivery apps (dining preferences)

### Advanced Intelligence

1. **Predictive Actions**: "You usually order pizza on Friday nights. Should I place your order?"
2. **Goal Tracking**: "You wanted to exercise 3x/week. You're at 2/3 this week."
3. **Habit Formation**: "You've checked your email 47 times today. Would you like me to batch notifications?"
4. **Relationship Intelligence**: "Your mom's birthday is in 2 weeks. Want help finding a gift?"

## Success Metrics

Track effectiveness through:

1. **Suggestion Acceptance Rate**: % of suggestions user accepts
2. **User Engagement**: How often user interacts with proactive features
3. **Time Saved**: Estimated time saved through automation
4. **User Feedback**: Explicit ratings on suggestion quality
5. **Profile Completeness**: % of profile fields filled

## Technical Decisions

### Why Plain Text Memory?
- ✅ LLMs are designed to work with natural language
- ✅ No rigid schema - agent can organize info however makes sense
- ✅ Human-readable and editable
- ✅ Simple to implement - just read/write files
- ✅ Easy to backup, version control, debug
- ✅ Agent can self-manage its own memory

### Why Separate Background Process?
- Doesn't block main UI
- Can run even when app is minimized
- Isolation from main chat interface
- Independent scheduling and timing

### Why LLM-Based Analysis?
- Flexible reasoning about context
- Natural language understanding
- Can explain suggestions to user
- Easy to improve by adjusting prompts
- Reuses existing agent infrastructure
